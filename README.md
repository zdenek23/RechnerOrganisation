Assignments for KU Rechnerorganisation TU Graz SS18

A1: From C to assembly. Input: ASCII-coded decimals. Convert them into binary form, possibly add them.
    Output: ASCII-coded decimals from input and result.
    
A2: Logisim simulation. Build synchronous automaton that reads ASCII-coded decimals, convert them into binary form
    and save them as variable "X".

A3: Logisim simulation. Modify A2 so that it outputs ASCII-coded decimals (input and result) on a monitor.

A4: From C to assemply and Logisim simulation. Using stack and function calls in assembly language.
    Functionality same as A3, but implemented as machine code for TOY-computer.
